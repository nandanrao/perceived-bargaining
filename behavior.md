# Introduction

The hypothesis of this paper is nothing more than "if you get a lot of rejections when applying for a certain type of job, your think your chances of getting such a job are low." In and of itself, this is not very controversial and, Ceteris Paribus, this is exactly what any model of rationality would predict. The hypothesis here, however, is that even Ceteris very-much-not-Paribus, and even when one's chances of geting a job are not actually lower, job seekers in the real world might percieve them to be this way and act accordingly, even if it is not in their best interest, when presented with a large number of rejections.

The context of this paper is to consider potential effects of a technology change that reduces the cost of applying to each job. Recent history is rife with such technologies, from the fax machine to the internet to the integrated profile-cum-job-boards such as LinkedIn. It is not hard to imagine that yet more such technological changes await us in the near future.

Given a reduction of costs, be they time or money, the number of applications sent per job-seekerwill, ceteris parabis, increase. As interviewing is still relatively unmediated by "time-saving" technologies, it is clear that the number of outright rejections the average job-seeker receives must naturally increase along with an increase in the number of applications the average job-seeker sends.

It is worth noting the difference between a technology lowering search costs and a technology lowering application costs. The cost of applying for a job consists of two parts: the cost of searching and the cost of actually sending the application. If one lowers the cost of searching, one would expect better-targeted applications. Lowering the cost of sending each marginal application, however, regardless of which part of the process changes, has an additional effect which is independent of the targeting: more applications are sent. I will not consider the effect of better-targeting applications in this paper, focusing instead on the potential effects of the increase in application volume independently of any other effects.

One might argue that probability of acceptance is actually the probability of winning a game which one is playing against all other potential applicants and all potential firms. In this paper I will assume that, in the game-theoretic taxonomy, this is an evolutionary game: there are too many other players to seriously claim that agents rationalize their strategies. Instead, they follow myopic strategies, and these myopic strategies inherently involve the estimatiion of the probability of getting each job before bothering to send the application.

How should we consider, then, the process of a job-seeker estimating the probability of getting a job, should they apply? Let us split the process into two parts:

1. The job seeker gathers, throughout their entire life, from family, friends, and school, a whole host of preconceptions about the state of the world and their own employability. They listen to the news, they hear rumors, they observe the experiencce of peers. 

2. The job seeker applies to some jobs, and through the process of applying, learns more about the probability of recieving offers from each kind of job and firm to which they apply.

This paper considers only the second part, abtracting away from whatever priors the job seeker has from before, we consider how they update their beliefs through the process of applying. 






For concretness, consider an applicant that has just spent a day applying to jobs and not received a single interview. Should the applicant spend another day applying to yet more jobs of the same kind, or should they direct their search to jobs that they deem "easier to get", jobs that by revealed preference must naturally be less desireable? This is clearly a question of expected utility and, given the fixed opportunity cost of one day and the known utility of recieving one of these jobs, the only piece of information that the applicant must attempt to estimate is the probability of acceptance.



What can go wrong, then, when people attempt to estimate the probability of getting a job? a


This is learning by experience: our applicant has had an experience of applying and being rejected and must learn the probability of further rejection. If acceptance is a "rare event", then we can expect applicants to underestimate its probability (cite: ).

# Conclusions


# Future Research
Understanding how individuals direct their job search is crucial if we want to model the labor market and the impact of poilicies on its efficiency. I have argued that job search is, at its core, a process in which individuals must necessarily make judgements about the probabilities of favorable outcomes to different actions.

Learning by experience is one way in which invidividuals estimate these probabilities and this paper has focused on enumerating and testing some statistical biases related to learning by experience. In the experiments, and in the cited literature, I have only considered these biases in "impersonal" contexts. If one judges the probability of winning a "game" to be low, this has nothing to do with their own value or self-worth as an individual. If one judges the probability of getting a job to be low, this a lot to do with their own value and self-worth as individuals!

A simple extension and logical next step would therefore be to understand how learning-by-experience biases change when one is estimating something that might reflect positively or negatively on one's own self image. \cite{} show that _________________, self-preservation, blah blah.

It must also be considered that learning by experience is not the only, and may not even be the primary, way in which individuals estimate the probability of getting a job. Clearly, people do not apply to every single job they would enjoy doing: they know aprior that they are "not qualified" to do certain jobs, akin to estimating the probability of success to essentially zero in those contexts. This estimation involves preconceptions about the world that arguably might affect the way in which people direct their search much more than learning by experience, but also might very much affect the way in which people learn by experience. /cite{} something about failures of bayesian updating in very generic way -- it's not only the prior that changes, but potentially also the updating itself.

This opens the question: how does public and private discourse effect the way in which people search for jobs? It is not hard to imagine that repeated exposure to negative discussions about the state of the economy and a high unemployment rate might come quickly to one's mind after a few rejections, even if it one felt quite confident beforehand.

Aditionally, I believe it is important to note that all of these affects might not only effect the directed search itself, but also the entire perception of bargaining power held by a majority of workers. If one underestimates the probability of getting a job, is one less likely to bargain for a higher wage, form a union, or petition for a raise after having worked for a while? In short, is it possible that a major change in the percieved bargaining power of workers can be caused by something as simple as a theoretically benevolent technological change that has the unfortunate side effect of increasing the absolute number of rejections for the majority of job seekers.
